# Simon Game

## Description
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game. The objective is to follow and repeat a sequence of lights and sounds for as long as possible. The game tests your memory and concentration skills with progressively longer sequences.

## Features
- A responsive game interface with four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow).
- Each button has a unique sound and animation when clicked.
- The game starts when a key is pressed and advances through levels as the sequence is correctly followed.
