# Simon Game

## Description

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game. The objective is to follow and repeat a sequence of lights and sounds for as long as possible. The game tests your memory and concentration skills with progressively longer sequences.

## Features

- A responsive game interface with four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow).
- Each button has a unique sound and animation when clicked.
- The game starts when a key is pressed and advances through levels as the sequence is correctly followed.
- Game-over feature with a restart option.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.).
- A computer or mobile device with internet access.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

How to Play
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Press any key to start the game.
Watch the sequence of button presses displayed by the game.
Click on the buttons to repeat the sequence in the same order.
If you successfully repeat the sequence, you will advance to the next level, and the sequence will become longer.
If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can restart by pressing any key.
Customization
The game is fully customizable using CSS. You can modify the styles.css file to change the appearance and layout of the game interface.
